Nimue: a Fiat-Shamir library
=========

**This library has not been externally reviewed yet and shouldn't be considered ready for deployments.**

Nimue is a hash-agnostic library that believes in random oracles.
It built on the top of the SAFE framework and provides an API for generating the verifier's and prover's random coins.

Check out the [documentation](https://docs.rs/nimue/latest/nimue/) and some [`examples/`](https://github.com/mmaker/nimue/tree/main/examples).
